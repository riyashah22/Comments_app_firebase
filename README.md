# Comments App

A Flutter application that allows users to view comments from an API. The app uses Firebase Remote Config to decide whether to display full email addresses or partially mask them.

## Features

- **View Comments**: Fetch comments from an API and display them in a list.
- **Firebase Remote Config**: Control whether to display full emails or mask part of the email (e.g., `joh*****@test.com`).
- **State Management**: Implemented using `Provider`.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: The email display changes dynamically based on the Remote Config setting.
